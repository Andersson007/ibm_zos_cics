IBM z/OS CICS Collection
========================

The **IBM z/OS CICS collection**, also represented as **ibm\_zos\_cics**
in this document, provides tasks to define, install, and perform actions on CICS definitions and resources such as creating a PROGRAM definition, installing and updating it, and deleting the definition.

The **IBM z/OS CICS collection** can work independently from other IBM z/OS modules on Ansible to perform tasks in CICS. You can, however, to use it in conjunction with the `IBM z/OS core collection`_ to achieve more automation on z/OS. If you do that, always refer to their documentation for extra configuration needed.
