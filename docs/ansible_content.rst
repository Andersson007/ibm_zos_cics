CICS Collection
========================

The **IBM® z/OS® CICS® collection**, also represented as **ibm\_zos\_cics**
in this document, is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible® Automation to IBM Z® through the offering Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®. It provides tasks to define, install, and perform actions on CICS definitions and resources such as creating a PROGRAM definition, installing and updating it, and deleting the definition.

The CICS collection can work in conjunction with or independently from other IBM z/OS collections on Ansible such as the `IBM z/OS core collection`_. When used alone, it performs automation tasks solely in CICS. When using it together with other z/OS collections, you can achieve a more powerful solution for automating tasks on z/OS.
