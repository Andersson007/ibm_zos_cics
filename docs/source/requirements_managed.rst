Requirements of managed nodes
=============================

The managed z/OS node is the host that is managed by Ansible, as identified in the Ansible inventory.

The IBM z/OS CICS collection calls the `CMCI REST API`_ of CICS to perform tasks in CICS. Therefore, it doesn't require Python to be installed on the managed node when used alone.

* `z/OS OpenSSH`_
* IBM CICS V4.2 or later
* `CMCI connection`_ must be set up in either a CICSPlex SM or a stand-alone CICS region

If you want to use the CICS collection in conjunction with other IBM z/OS collections, you must follow their specific requirements, for example, `IBM z/OS core managed node requirements`_.
