IBM z/OS CICS collection
========================

The **IBM® z/OS® CICS® collection**, also represented as **ibm\_zos\_cics**
in this document, is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible® Automation to IBM Z® through the offering **Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z**. The IBM z/OS CICS collection supports management of CICS resources and definitions via the CMCI REST API provided by CICS.

This CICS collection can work independently from other IBM z/OS modules on Ansible to perform tasks in CICS. You can, however, use it in conjunction with other IBM z/OS collections such as the 
[IBM z/OS core collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core) 
to deliver a solution that will enable you to automate tasks on z/OS.


Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

**Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to connect IBM Z to clients\' wider enterprise automation strategy through the Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in one easy-to-use platform.

The **The IBM z/OS CICS collection** is following the **Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** method of distributing content. Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready for use it is released to [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?keywords=zos_&order_by=-relevance&deprecated=false&type=collection&page=1) for community adoption. Once contributors review community usage, feedback, and are satisfied with the content published, the collection will then be released to [Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub) as certified and IBM supported for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscribers.
